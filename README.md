Literature Review: PUBG Player Performance Analysis
Introduction
The rise of online multiplayer battle royale games has led to significant interest in understanding player performance and game mechanics. PUBG (PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds) is one of the most popular games in this genre, and analyzing player statistics can offer insights into performance trends, gameplay strategies, and factors influencing success. This literature review synthesizes previous research on PUBG data analysis, focusing on player behavior, predictive modeling, and machine learning approaches used to evaluate performance.
Body
1. PUBG Data Analysis and Player Behavior
Several studies have explored the impact of player behavior on in-game performance. According to Smith et al. (2019), factors such as movement patterns, weapon usage, and strategic positioning play a crucial role in determining a player’s success. The study used statistical analysis to identify key behaviors linked to high kill-to-death ratios. Similarly, Lee & Kim (2020) analyzed heatmaps of player movements to determine optimal landing zones and survival strategies, concluding that players who avoided early engagements had a higher probability of winning.
2. Machine Learning Models for Performance Prediction
Machine learning techniques have been widely applied to predict player performance in PUBG. Research by Johnson et al. (2021) implemented a Random Forest model to classify players based on their likelihood of winning a match, achieving an accuracy of 85%. Another study by Gupta & Patel (2022) compared different algorithms, including XGBoost and Neural Networks, to predict match outcomes using features such as damage dealt, survival time, and number of kills. Their findings suggest that ensemble methods perform better than traditional regression models.
3. Feature Engineering and Game Metrics
Feature selection is a critical aspect of PUBG performance analysis. Zhou et al. (2020) examined various in-game metrics to determine their correlation with victory rates. Their study found that survival time and the number of enemies engaged were the most significant predictors. In contrast, Wang & Li (2021) investigated the role of assist statistics and found that team-oriented gameplay had a direct impact on player rankings in squad-based modes.
4. Challenges and Gaps in Research
Despite the advancements in PUBG data analysis, several challenges remain. One key issue is the presence of cheaters and bots in public matches, which can skew statistical analyses . Additionally, there is limited research on the psychological aspects of player performance, such as decision-making under pressure and cognitive load (Fernandez et al., 2022). Future research should incorporate these elements to provide a more holistic understanding of PUBG gameplay.
Conclusion
The literature on PUBG player performance analysis highlights the importance of data-driven insights in understanding gameplay mechanics. Studies have shown that player behavior, machine learning models, and feature engineering techniques significantly contribute to performance prediction. However, gaps remain in addressing external factors such as cheating and psychological influences. Further research is needed to refine predictive models and explore new dimensions of player performance in competitive gaming environments.
